# Maze-Solver-using-Stacks-and-Queues
A Java-based maze solver that explores the use of stacks and queues as worklists for search algorithms. The project implements and compares Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find paths in a maze while analyzing the impact of different worklist structures.
